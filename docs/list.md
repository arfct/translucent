These widgets are examples. Widgets can come from this site<br>—<i>or anywhere on the web.</i>

Use the browser's <span class="material-symbols-rounded" style="font-size:80%">ios_share</span> share action<br>to open a website in <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/64xgwI8e">widget.vision</a><br>…and then customize it! (A restart may be needed for the share action to show in Safari)
